# CART-regression-and-classification
Introduction to CART
Classification and Regression Trees (CART) are a type of decision tree algorithm used in machine learning. They are used for both classification and regression tasks. A CART tree breaks down a dataset into subsets, and it recursively divides these subsets into smaller, more homogeneous groups until a stopping criterion is met. The result is a tree structure that can be used for predictions and decision making.

CART is widely used in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and marketing, due to its simplicity, interpretability, and good performance. It is a fundamental tool for understanding the relationships in your data and making predictions based on those relationships.

Repository Contents
This repository contains the following key components:

R Implementation: You'll find R-code to build and train CART trees for both classification and regression tasks.

Sample Datasets: A collection of sample datasets that you can use to practice building CART trees. They were collected from: Autoantibodies targeting GPCRs and RAS-related molecules associate with COVID-19 severity. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28905-5

Resources: Links to additional resources, articles, and books for further learning about CART and decision trees.
